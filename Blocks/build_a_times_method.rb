Tracing code execution of the above code:

1. Method invocation starts at line 13, when the `times` method is called with an argument, `5`, and a block of code.
2. Execution enters the first line of the method implementation at line 3, where the local variable `counter` is initialized.
3. Execution continues to line 4. The `while` conditional is evaluated. The first time through, the condition is true.
4. Execution continues to line 5, which yields to the block. This is the same as executing the block of code, and this time, we are executing the block of code with an arugment. The argument to the block is the `counter`, which is `0` the first time through.
5. Execution jumps to the block on line 13, so that the block local variable `num` is assigned to the object referenced by `counter`, i.e. `num` is assigned to `0`.
6. Execution continues in the block to line 14, which outputs the block local variable `num`.
7. Reaching the end of the block, execution continues back to the `times` method implementation on line 6, where `counter` is incremented.
8. Reaching the end of the `while` loop, execution continues on line 4, essentially repeating steps 3 through 7.
9. At some point, the `while` conditional should return false (otherwise, I have an infinite loop), allowing execution to flow to line 9, which doesn't do anything.
10. Reaching the end of the method at line 10, execution will return the last expression in this method, which is the `number` local variable.
