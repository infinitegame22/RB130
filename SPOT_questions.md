# Practice Questions

10. What is `yield` in Ruby and how do we use it? 

In Ruby, the yield keyword is used to define a block within a method. It allows you to transfer control from the method to the block and then return to the method when the block execution is complete. Essentially, yield enables you to create methods that can accept blocks of code as arguments.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of yield:



def greet
  puts "Hello!"
  yield if block_given?
  puts "Goodbye!"
end

greet do
  puts "Welcome to the Ruby world!"
end
In this example, we define a method called greet. Within the method, we use puts to display "Hello!" and "Goodbye!". Then, we have the yield statement, which checks if a block has been passed to the method using the block_given? method. If a block is provided, the control is transferred to the block and the block code is executed.

When you invoke the greet method with a block, like in the example above, the block code puts "Welcome to the Ruby world!" will be executed after the "Hello!" message is displayed. Finally, the control returns to the greet method, and the "Goodbye!" message is printed.

The output of running this code will be:

css
Copy code
Hello!
Welcome to the Ruby world!
Goodbye!
If you call the greet method without a block, like greet, the yield statement is skipped, and only the "Hello!" and "Goodbye!" messages are displayed.

This is just a basic example to demonstrate the usage of yield. yield can be powerful when you need to provide flexibility and customization in your methods by allowing users to pass in blocks of code to be executed at specific points within the method.

11. How do we check if a block is passed into a method?

In Ruby, you can check if a block is passed into a method by using the block_given? method. This method returns true if a block is provided when the method is called, and false otherwise. Here are a couple of examples:

Example 1: Method without a block

ruby
Copy code
def do_something
  if block_given?
    puts "A block is provided"
  else
    puts "No block is provided"
  end
end

do_something
# Output: No block is provided
Example 2: Method with a block

ruby
Copy code
def do_something
  if block_given?
    yield
  else
    puts "No block is provided"
  end
end

do_something { puts "Executing block" }
# Output: Executing block
In the first example, the do_something method checks if a block is given using block_given? and prints the corresponding message.

In the second example, the do_something method again checks if a block is given using block_given?. If a block is provided, it executes the block using the yield keyword. In this case, the block contains the code puts "Executing block", which is printed as output.

12. Why is it important to know that methods and blocks can return closures in Ruby?

Knowing that methods and blocks can return closures is of paramount importance, for it unlocks the power of encapsulating behavior within a portable package. A closure is a delightful combination of code and its surrounding environment.  When a method or block returns a closure, this is a snippet of executable code that remembers its surroundings, even when executed and used elsewhere.

For example, let's say we have a method called `greetings_generator` that takes a name as an argument and returns a closure.  Within this closure, the name is captured and stored for future use.

```ruby
def greetings_generator(name)
  proc { |greeting| puts "#{greeting}, #{name}!" }
end

wizard_greetings = greetings_generator("Gandalf")
wizard_greetings.call("Greetings")  # => "Greetings, Gandalf!"
```
By returning a closure from the method, we created a reusable chunk of functionality capable of greeting the chosen name.  The closure retains a reference to the `name` variable allowing us to offer personalized greetings whenever invoked.

Another example of how blocks can yield closures as well.  When a method yields a closures, it grants the user the ability to manipulate its behavior from within the method.

```ruby
def sorcery
  puts "Before enchantment"
  yield if block_given?
  puts "After enchantment"
end

sorcery do
  puts "Behold the magic within!"
end
```
By yielding to a closure, the `sorcery` method allows the provided block to create its own magic inside of the method call.

13. What are the benefits of explicit blocks?

- Explicit blocks provide additional flexibility. The advantage of having a variable that represents the block is that we can pass the block to another method.  can be used as arguments with another method.  Use the explicit block to convert the proc to a block for execution.  

```ruby

  def puppy_check(&block)
    arr =['small', 'killer', 'mr.cheese']
    arr.each &block
  end

  block = proc { |dog| puts dog }
   
  puppy_check(&block) # => small, killer, mr. cheese

  def my_method(&block)
  block.call
end

my_proc = proc { puts "Hey there"}
my_method(&my_proc) # => Hey there
```

14, Describe the arity differences of blocks, procs, methods and lambdas.

1. Blocks are chunks of code enclosed either within `{}` or `do...end` keywords. They are not standalone objects and are typically associated with methods. Blocks have lenient arity meaning Ruby doesn't complain when passing in too many or too few arguments to a block.

`[1,2,3].each { |num, int| puts num * 2 }`

The block example above 

2. Procs are objects that encapsulate blocks of code. They can be created using the `Proc.new` or `proc` methods. Procs have lenient arity just like blocks.

```ruby
my_proc = Proc.new { |a, b| puts a + b }
my_proc.call(2,3,4) # Output: 5
```

In the code snippet above when we pass in the three integers `2`, `3`, and `4` as arguments to the `call` method, Ruby does not throw an ArgumentError and is able to assign `2` and `3` to the block arguments `a` and `b`.

3. Methods:
Methods in Ruby are defined using the `def` keyword and can have a specified number of parameters.  Methods have strict arity so they need to be called with the exact number of arguments they are defined with or else Ruby will throw an ArgumentError.

```ruby
def add_numbers(a,b)
  puts a + b
end

add_numbers(2, 3) # => 5
add_numbers(2, 3, 4) # => ArgumentError
```
4. Lambdas:  Lambdas are types of procs, but they have stricter arity rules. They can be created using the lambda keyword or the `->` (stabby lambda) syntax. Lambdas check the number of arguments passed to them and raise an error if the arity does not match.

```ruby
my_lambda = ->(a, b) { puts a + b }
my_lambda.call(2, 3)  # Output: 5
```

16. What does & do when in a the method parameter?

`def method(&var); end`

When we use the & symbol in a method definition parameter, it is used to convert a block or Proc object into a block (more specifically, it converts a Proc object to a block).
Here’s an example:
def my_method(&block)
  block.call
end

my_proc = Proc.new { puts "Hello, world!" }

my_method(&my_proc)
In this example, we define a method called my_method that takes a block as an argument. We use the & symbol in front of the blockparameter to convert the block into a Proc object and assign it to the block variable.
We then create a Proc object called my_proc that prints “Hello, world!” when executed. Finally, we call the my_method method with the my_proc object passed in as an argument, using the & symbol to convert it back to a block.
When we execute the code, the my_method method is called with the my_proc Proc object passed in, and the “Hello, world!” message is printed, since we used the call method on the block parameter to execute the block.
So, when we pass a Proc object to a method that has the & symbol in front of a parameter, it will convert the Proc object to a block and assign it to the parameter, making it callable within the method.

Using & before a parameter is a way to handle and work with blocks of code as objects in Ruby. It’s commonly used when you want to pass a block to another method or store it for later use.

In the method definition the `&` converts the block object to a Proc.  

17, What does & do when in a method invocation argument?

`method(&var)`
- converts Proc to a block so that the method expecting the explicit block gets what it needs.

18. What is happening in the code below?

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

p arr.map(&:to_s) # specifically `&:to_s`

Symbol to Proc

A RubyGem or Gem is a external library or application which can be downloaded, installed and used in our Ruby programs or from the command line. The `gem` command comes standard with Ruby installation now a days, this command allows us to instal and manage our Gems.

18. What is happening in the code below?

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

p arr.map(&:to_s) # specifically `&:to_s`
```

Just like Proc objects, objects that are not a proc can be converted to a block when prepended by the unary &.  But first Ruby needs to convert that object to a proc object, then to a block. When that object is a symbol ruby uses the `Symbol#to_proc` method to convert that object into a Proc first. This proc's closure takes one argument and will call a method on the argued object based on the name of the calling symbol object. In the example below the `&:to_s` is equivalent to creating a proc object which will be converted to this block `{|w| w.to_s}` when prepended by the unary & in the method call to map.

we execute on the object passed in as the argument because an an argument doesn't exist until an object is passed in and attached to it.  

```ruby
def call_this
  yield(2)
end

# your code here
to_s = proc { |num| num.to_i }
to_i = Proc.new { |num| num.to_s }


p call_this(&to_s) # => returns 2
p call_this(&to_i) # => returns "2"

def call_this
  yield(2)
end

# your code here
to_s = false
a = proc do |x| 
  to_s = !to_s
  to_s ? x.to_i : x.to_s
end

p call_this(&a) # => returns 2
p call_this(&a) # => returns "2"

def call_this
  yield(2)
end

# your code here
def changer 
  to_s = false
  proc do |x| 
    to_s = !to_s
    to_s ? x.to_i : x.to_s
  end
end 

a = changer 

p call_this(&a) # => returns 2
p call_this(&a) # => returns "2"
```

modifying the variable as part of its closure.

20, How do we invoke an explicit block passed into a method using &? Provide example.

```ruby
def invoke_block(&block)
  # Now, we can invoke the block using the call method
  block.call
  yield() # will output a second time as we yield to the method
end

my_block = Proc.new { puts "Hello, block!" }

# Invoke the block using the method
invoke_block(&my_block) # => Hello, block!
                        #    Hello, block!
```

When we invoke a method that defines a final parameter which is prepended by the unary `&` and pass that method a block upon invocation, that blcok is converted to a Proc and assinged to the arugment name after the `&`. We can then call the  `Proc#call` on that object or directly yield to the block that was passed in as it is still available to exectue the block. 

```ruby
def block_method(animal)
  yield(animal)
end

block_method('turtle') do |turtle, seal|
  puts "This is a #{turtle} and a #{seal}."
end
```
This code will output 'This is a turtle and a .' and return nil.

On line 69 we call `block_method` and pass the string `'turtle'` and a block as arguments to the method call. Inside this method the string is assigned to the method local variable `animal`. 
In this method we yield to the block and pass the object refernced by `animal` to it. The string `'turtle'` is then assigned to the block parameter `turtle` and the block parameter `seal` is not passed an arugment so it is assigned to `nil`. This is due to the arity of blocks which is the rule regarding the number of arugments a block proc or lambda requrie for the code to run without errors. Blocks have lenient arity meaning they do not require the exact number of arguments they define in their parameter list (everythingbetween the `||`). If they recived less arugments any unassinged parameters will be assigned to nil and if they rrecive more arugments then any extra arugments will be ignored. 
So when we interpolate our arugments into the string and output them to the screen with `#puts` we will get `'This is a turtle and a .'` because `nil` interpolates to an empty string. 

This code will output 'This is a turtle and a .' and return nil.

Unlike methods a block will not thorw an error if passed the incorrect number of arguments.

```ruby
def block_method(animal)
  yield(animal)
end

block_method('turtle') { puts "This is a #{animal}."}
# => NameError: no local variable or method found
```
This code will throw a `NameError` when run.  The block local variable `animal` has no value to reference and thus cannot be interpolated into the string.
On line 88 we invoke the `block_method` and pass it one string argument `'turtle`' and one block argument `{puts "This is a(n) #{animal}."}`.  A block only knows its own scope unless we pass it an object specifically to be assigned to a local block parameter. For example, if we add a block parameter `|animal|` to the code above, this code executes as imagined.

```ruby
def block_method(animal)
  yield(animal)
end

block_method('turtle') { |animal| puts "This is a(n) #{animal}."}

# => This is a turtle.
```

What are the core tools of Ruby?

We have a few core tools in Ruby which allow us to modify 

A RubyGem or Gem is a external library or application which can be downloaded, installed and used in our Ruby programs or from the command line. The `gem` command comes standard with Ruby installation now a days, this command allows us to instal and manage our Gems.

In Ruby, the assert_equal method is commonly used in testing frameworks, such as MiniTest, to compare the equality of two values. It verifies that the expected value is equal to the actual value and raises an error if they differ.

43, How does assert_equal compare its arguments?

When assert_equal compares its arguments, it uses the == operator to check for equality. The == operator is defined for different classes and types in Ruby, and its behavior can be customized by overriding the == method in your own classes.

Here's an example of how assert_equal is typically used in a test case:

ruby
Copy code
require 'test/unit'

class MyTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_addition
    result = 2 + 2
    assert_equal(4, result)
  end
end
In this example, the test_addition method verifies that the result of adding 2 and 2 is equal to 4. If the assert_equal statement fails because the values are not equal, an assertion error will be raised, indicating that the test has failed.

Note that assert_equal can compare various data types, including numbers, strings, arrays, and objects. It will call the == method appropriate to the data types being compared. If you need to compare complex objects, you may need to override the == method in your class to define what equality means for your objects.

What is the SEAT approach and why is it useful?

The SEAT approach is a testing pattern or methodology commonly used in software testing, including Ruby testing. It stands for:

Set up: In this phase, you prepare the necessary objects, data, and environment required for the test. This may involve creating instances of classes, setting up test fixtures, or mocking dependencies.
Execute: This is the phase where you actually run or execute the code you want to test. It could involve calling methods or functions, passing input values, or triggering certain events.
Assert: After executing the code, you compare the actual results or behavior against the expected outcome. You define assertions to verify that the executed code behaves correctly and produces the desired output.
Tear down: Once the test has been executed and assertions have been made, it's important to clean up any resources or artifacts created during the test. This could involve releasing memory, deleting temporary files, or resetting the state of objects or databases.
The SEAT approach follows a structured pattern for organizing and writing tests, ensuring that each test case is self-contained and independent. By separating the setup, execution, assertion, and teardown phases, it promotes clean and maintainable test code. It also helps in isolating test cases from each other, preventing interference or dependencies between tests.

Using the SEAT approach can lead to more robust and reliable test suites, making it easier to identify and fix issues when they arise. It also enhances readability and allows other developers to understand the purpose and requirements of each test case more effectively.

In Ruby testing frameworks like Minitest or RSpec, you typically define setup and teardown logic within special methods provided by the testing framework. Here's a brief overview of when these methods are called:

Setup:
The setup logic is executed before each test case to set up the necessary preconditions. This step is used to initialize any required objects, establish connections to databases or external services, or perform any other necessary setup tasks. It ensures that each test starts with a clean and consistent state.

Teardown:
The teardown logic is executed after each test case to clean up any resources that were created during setup or the test execution. It is used to release resources, close connections, or perform any necessary cleanup tasks.

```ruby
class MyTest < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    # Setup logic here
  end

  def teardown
    # Teardown logic here
  end

  # Test cases
end

```

46. What is code coverage?

Code coverage in Ruby refers to the measurement of how much of your Ruby code is being executed during your tests. It is a metric that helps you understand the effectiveness of your test suite by determining which parts of your code are covered by tests and which parts are not.

Code coverage is usually expressed as a percentage and indicates the proportion of lines, branches, or instructions that are executed during the test run. It can be calculated using various tools and libraries, such as SimpleCov, which is a popular code coverage tool for Ruby.

When you run your tests with code coverage enabled, the tool monitors the execution of your code and keeps track of which lines or branches are visited. After the tests are complete, it generates a report that highlights the areas of code that were covered and the areas that were not.

By analyzing the code coverage report, you can identify parts of your codebase that lack test coverage, allowing you to focus your testing efforts on those areas. This helps you ensure that critical parts of your application are thoroughly tested and reduces the risk of undetected bugs.

Code coverage should not be the sole indicator of the quality of your tests, as it only measures the execution of code and not the correctness of the tests themselves. It is important to combine code coverage analysis with other testing practices, such as unit testing, integration testing, and test-driven development, to achieve comprehensive and reliable test coverage


48, What are the purpose of core tools?

Core tools refer to what is in our toolbox as a programmer in Ruby.  In our toolbox exists four important tools: Bundler, Ruby Version Manager, Rakefile and RubyGems.

 Bundler is a tool used for managing dependencies in Ruby projects. It helps ensure that the correct versions of gems (Ruby libraries) are installed and used in your project. With Bundler, you can define your project's gem dependencies in a file called Gemfile. It allows you to specify the required gem versions and any specific configurations. Bundler then resolves the dependencies and installs the appropriate gem versions, creating a consistent and isolated environment for your project.

Ruby Version Manager (RVM) is a command-line tool that allows you to manage multiple Ruby versions on your system. It enables you to switch between different Ruby versions seamlessly, based on your project's requirements or personal preferences. RVM simplifies the installation and management of Ruby interpreters, allowing you to maintain separate gemsets for each Ruby version. It also provides the ability to specify the default Ruby version for your system.

RubyGems: RubyGems is the package manager for Ruby. It is responsible for packaging and distributing Ruby libraries and managing their installation. RubyGems provides a vast ecosystem of open-source gems that you can easily install and use in your projects. With RubyGems, you can search for gems, install them, and manage their versions. It also allows you to create and publish your own gems, making it straightforward to share your code with others.

 Rakefile is a configuration file used by Rake, a build automation tool for Ruby projects. Rake provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining tasks and dependencies in your project. A Rakefile contains a set of tasks with their associated actions, such as compiling code, running tests, deploying applications, or any other custom build processes. Rake allows you to define task dependencies, execute tasks in a specific order, and run only the necessary tasks based on the changes in your source code.

Bundler: Manages gem dependencies in your Ruby project.
Ruby Version Manager (RVM): Manages multiple Ruby versions on your system.
RubyGems: Packages and distributes Ruby libraries (gems) and manages their installation.
Rakefile: Defines tasks and dependencies for build automation using Rake.
These tools are widely used in the Ruby ecosystem to facilitate dependency management, version control, package distribution, and project build processes.

50, What are Version Managers and why are they useful?

ersion managers are tools used in software development to manage multiple versions of programming language runtimes or libraries on a single system. They allow developers to switch between different versions of a language or library, depending on the requirements of their projects.

In the context of Ruby, there are several popular version managers available, such as rbenv, RVM (Ruby Version Manager), and chruby. These tools help manage multiple Ruby installations and allow developers to easily switch between different versions.

Version managers are useful in Ruby development for project-specific dependencies, easy environment setup and seamless upgrades.

Different Ruby projects may have different dependencies and requirements. Version managers allow developers to specify the Ruby version and gem dependencies specific to each project, ensuring that the correct versions are used without conflicts.
Multiple Ruby versions: Version managers enable developers to install and use multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine. This is particularly useful when working on projects that rely on different Ruby versions, or when testing compatibility across different Ruby releases.

Version managers simplify the setup process for new development environments. Instead of manually installing and configuring Ruby and its dependencies, version managers automate the installation process, making it easier and more consistent across different systems.

When a new version of Ruby is released, version managers make it straightforward to upgrade existing installations or switch to the latest version. This allows developers to take advantage of new language features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

Overall, version managers in Ruby simplify the management of multiple Ruby installations, ensure project-specific dependencies, and provide flexibility in working with different Ruby versions, making the development process smoother and more efficient.

53, What constitues a Ruby project?

A Ruby project typically refers to a software project that is developed using the Ruby programming language. Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

Some key elements that often constitute a Ruby project are Ruby code, a gemfile, specific directory structure, a rakefile, and a set of tests.

 A Ruby project consists of one or more Ruby source code files (.rb). These files contain the actual implementation of the software using the Ruby programming language syntax.

 A Gemfile is a file used in Ruby projects to specify the project's dependencies. It lists the libraries, known as gems, that the project relies on. The Gemfile can be used with tools like Bundler to manage and install the required gems.

A typical Ruby project follows a certain directory structure to organize the code and related files, like Rubygems. It may include directories such as "lib" for storing Ruby code files.

A Rakefile is a Ruby script that defines tasks for automating common project-related operations. It uses the Rake tool, which is Ruby's equivalent of Make in other programming languages. The Rakefile can contain tasks for tasks such as running tests, building the project, deploying, and more.

Ruby projects often include automated tests to verify the correctness of the code. The tests are typically written using a testing framework such as RSpec or MiniTest. The test files may be stored in a separate directory, such as "spec" or "test."

These elements provide a general framework for organizing and developing a Ruby project. However, it's important to note that the specific structure and tools used can vary depending on the project's requirements and the development team's preferences.
