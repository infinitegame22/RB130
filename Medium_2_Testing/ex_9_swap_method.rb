=begin
To write this test we'll need to first create an instance of class `Text`.
Then, we need to pass it the text we want to work on. To do that we'll have 
to read that text from the sample text file. First, we must open the file for 
reading. We want to keep things directly related to our test in our test method.
So, any code that is necessary to setup the test is a perfect candidate for the 
`#setup` method. We do so in our soution by opening the file in question and
assigning the file object to an instance variable. 

Once we have passed in the contents of that file to the `Text` class, we're 
ready to make the command that will lead to the assertion for this test. That 
command is the call to `Text#swap`. In this case, the exercise asks us to use
`a` and `e` as the letters to swap out. The return value of this `Text#swap` 
method is what we will use to test that this method is working as intended.

Next, we need a String that we can test against the return value of `Text#swap`.
This will be our expected value for the later assertion. To get this String, we
just take the contents of the file and process it manually with our text editor
to replace all of the `a`s with `e`s.

Finally, we use `assert_equal` to ensure that the expected value of the text is
equal to the actual value.
